In the contemporary world, it is of great significance for youngsters to learn English well and thus, English learning has gained great popularity. Based on a survey, a majority of international organizations or firms acknowledge that they prefer recruiting employees who can speak English fluently.
However, a host of English learners may have a variety of difficulties or troubles in learning. For instance, a large number of students ifnd it difficult ot memorize new words. Frequently, it is also difficult for them to understand rules of English grammar. In addition, though some are good at reading or writing, they fail to express themselves freely in oral English.
Then, how to get a good command of this language? I am convinced that practice makes perfect. Only practice can help me to master grammatical knowledge and remember new words. And it is also through practice that I can speak and write fluently, and there is no other way. I deem that if I try my utmost to practice English every day, the future of my English learning will be promising and hopeful.
